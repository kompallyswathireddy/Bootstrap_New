            <dt>1a. Explain why steel pans have handles made of plastic or wood.</dt>
            <dd>Steel pans have handles made of plastic or wood because these materials are <mark>poor conductors of heat,</mark> meaning they are <make>thermal insulators</mark>. This <mark>property</mark> prevents heat from the pan from transferring to the handle, allowing it to remain cool and safe to touch. Metals like steel are a <mark>good conductor of heat</mark>, which would cause the handle to become dangerously hot.</dd>

            <dt>1b. Suggest which material, felt or paper, is the better insulator. Give a reason for your answer.
            </dt>
            <dd>Felt is the <mark>better insulator</mark> because it has <mark>more air in its fibers</mark>, which reduces <mark>heat transfer</mark>. Air is a bad conductor of heat, and the <mark>structure of felt has better insulation</mark> compared to the thin and compact structure of paper.

            <dt >2a. Choose a material you would use to line a pair of winter boots. Give a reason for your choice of material.
            </dt>
            <dd>Wool would be a good material to line winter boots because it is an <mark>excellent insulator</mark>, trapping air in its fibers to retain heat. Additionally, <mark>wool is breathable and can wick moisture</mark> away, keeping feet warm and dry.

            <dt>2b. Describe how you could carry out a test on three different lining materials. Assume you have a thermometer and a stopwatch, and you can wrap the lining around a container of hot water. 
            </dt>
            <dd>Wrap <mark>equal</mark> amounts of the three materials (e.g. wool, felt, cotton) around <mark>identical containers</mark> filled with hot water. Use a thermometer to measure the <mark>initial temperature</mark> of the water in each container. Start a stopwatch and record the temperature of the water at regular intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes) for a set time (e.g. 30 minutes). Compare the temperature changes over time. The material that shows the smallest temperature drop is the <mark>best insulator</mark>.
